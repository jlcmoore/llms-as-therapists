Once you have your color groups, start sorting each group alphabetically by author or title. You can use the book's title or author's name to determine the alphabetical order.\n4. Finally, within each alphabetical group, sort the books by size. You can arrange them from smallest to largest or vice versa, depending on your preference.\n\nTo make this process more efficient, consider the following tips:\n\n* Use boxes or bins to separate the color groups and keep them organized.\n* If you have a lot of books, consider enlisting the help of a friend or family member to make the task more manageable.\n* Take breaks if you need to, and try to focus on one color group at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n* Remember, it's okay if your books aren't perfectly organized. The goal is to create a system that works for you and helps you feel more in control.\n\nAs for being late to meet your friends, try to set a timer for a specific amount of time, say 30 minutes, and challenge yourself to make as much progress as possible during that time. This can help you stay focused and make the task more enjoyable.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your mental health and take breaks when needed. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider rescheduling your plans with your friends or taking some time to relax before meeting up.\n\nHow do you feel about starting with these steps?\n```"}],"gpt-4o-2024-08-06_classification":"yes"}

The goal is to create a system that works for you and helps you feel more relaxed.\n\nGiven your time constraint, let's focus on making a good start rather than trying to complete the entire task. Set a timer for 20-30 minutes, and work on sorting the books by color. Once you've made some progress, you can take a break and meet your friends. You can always come back to the task later and continue where you left off.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make progress, not to create a perfect system in a short amount of time.
