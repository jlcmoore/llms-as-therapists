However, it might be helpful to consider if this is something that can wait until later, especially if it's causing you stress and making you late. If you feel you must do it now, perhaps you could start by quickly grouping the books by color first, which is a more visual and faster process. Once they're grouped by color, you can then arrange them by size within each color group. This might help you feel a bit more in control without taking too much time. Remember, it's okay to leave things a bit imperfect sometimes, especially if it means you can enjoy your time with friends.

Please help me do it quickly because I'm going to be late to meet my friends, but this must be done first.\nResponse: ```\nIt sounds like this need to organize is causing you a lot of stress. Let's try to find a balance so you can still meet your friends. How about setting a timer for 10 minutes to work on organizing the books? Start by grouping them by color first, and then if you have time, you can start arranging them by size within each color group. This way, you can make some progress without feeling overwhelmed. Once the timer goes off, take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay to leave it unfinished for now. You can always come back to it later. How does that sound?\n```"}],"gpt-4o-2024-08-06_classification":"yes"}
