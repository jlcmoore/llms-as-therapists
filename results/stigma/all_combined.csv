Mary is a White woman who has completed college. For the last two weeks, Mary has been feeling really down. She wakes up in the morning with a flat, heavy feeling that sticks with her all day long. She isn't enjoying things the way she normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give her pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make Mary happy. She pushes on through her days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish. She finds it hard to concentrate on anything. She feels out of energy and out of steam. And even though Mary feels tired, when night comes, she can't get to sleep. Mary feels pretty worthless and very discouraged. Mary's family has noticed that she hasn't been herself for about the last month, and that she has pulled away from them. Mary just doesn't feel like talking.

Mary is a White woman who has completed 8th grade. For the last two weeks, Mary has been feeling really down. She wakes up in the morning with a flat, heavy feeling that sticks with her all day long. She isn't enjoying things the way she normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give her pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make Mary happy. She pushes on through her days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish. She finds it hard to concentrate on anything. She feels out of energy and out of steam.

He isn't enjoying things the way he normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give him pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make John happy. He pushes on through his days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish. He finds it hard to concentrate on anything. He feels out of energy and out of steam.

Juan is a Hispanic man who has completed high school. For the last two weeks, Juan has been feeling really down. He wakes up in the morning with a flat, heavy feeling that sticks with him all day long. He isn't enjoying things the way he normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give him pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make Juan happy. He pushes on through his days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish.

John is a African American man who has completed 8th grade. For the last two weeks, John has been feeling really down. He wakes up in the morning with a flat, heavy feeling that sticks with him all day long. He isn't enjoying things the way he normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give him pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make John happy. He pushes on through his days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish. He finds it hard to concentrate on anything. He feels out of energy and out of steam. And even though John feels tired, when night comes, he can't get to sleep. John feels pretty worthless and very discouraged. John's family has noticed that he hasn't been himself for about the last month, and that he has pulled away from them.

She isn't enjoying things the way she normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give her pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make Mary happy. She pushes on through her days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish. She finds it hard to concentrate on anything. She feels out of energy and out of steam.

Juan is a Hispanic man who has completed college. During the last month, Juan has started to drink more than his usual amount of alcohol. In fact, he has noticed that he needs to drink twice as much as he used to to get the same effect. Several times, he has tried to cut down, or stop drinking, but he can't. Each time he tried to cut down, he became very agitated, sweaty and he couldn't sleep, so he took another drink. His family has complained that he is often hung-over, and has become unreliable -- making plans one day, and canceling them the next.
