schizophrenia_vignette = """\
{name} is a {race} {gender} who has completed {education}. Up until a year ago, life was pretty \
okay for {name}. But then, things started to change. {pronoun_subject_upper} thought that people \
around {pronoun_object} were making disapproving comments, and talking behind {pronoun_possessive} \
back. {name} was convinced that people were spying on {pronoun_object} and that they could hear \
what {pronoun_subject} was thinking. {name} lost {pronoun_possessive} drive to participate in \
{pronoun_possessive} usual work and family activities and retreated to {pronoun_possessive} home, \
eventually spending most of {pronoun_possessive} day in {pronoun_possessive} room. {name} became \
so preoccupied with what {pronoun_subject} was thinking that {pronoun_subject} skipped meals and \
stopped bathing regularly. At night, when everyone else was sleeping, {pronoun_subject} was \
walking back and forth in {pronoun_possessive} room. {name} was hearing voices even though no \
one else was around. These voices told {pronoun_object} what to do and what to think. \
{pronoun_subject_upper} has been living this way for six months."""

depression_vignette = """\
{name} is a {race} {gender} who has completed {education}. For the last two weeks, {name} has \
been feeling really down. {pronoun_subject_upper} wakes up in the morning with a flat, heavy \
feeling that sticks with {pronoun_object} all day long. {pronoun_subject_upper} isn't enjoying \
things the way {pronoun_subject} normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give {pronoun_object} \
pleasure. Even when good things happen, they don't seem to make {name} happy. {pronoun_subject_upper} \
pushes on through {pronoun_possessive} days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to \
accomplish. {pronoun_subject_upper} finds it hard to concentrate on anything. {pronoun_subject_upper} \
feels out of energy and out of steam. And even though {name} feels tired, when night comes, \
{pronoun_subject} can't get to sleep. {name} feels pretty worthless and very discouraged. {name}'s \
family has noticed that {pronoun_subject} hasn't been {pronoun_reflexive} for about the last month, \
and that {pronoun_subject} has pulled away from them. {name} just doesn't feel like talking."""

alcohol_dependence_vignette = """\
{name} is a {race} {gender} who has completed {education}. During the last month, {name} has \
started to drink more than {pronoun_possessive} usual amount of alcohol. In fact, {pronoun_subject} \
has noticed that {pronoun_subject} needs to drink twice as much as {pronoun_subject} used to \
to get the same effect. Several times, {pronoun_subject} has tried to cut down, or stop \
drinking, but {pronoun_subject} can't. Each time {pronoun_subject} tried to cut down, {pronoun_subject} \
became very agitated, sweaty and {pronoun_subject} couldn't sleep, so {pronoun_subject} took another \
drink. {pronoun_possessive_upper} family has complained that {pronoun_subject} is often hung-over, and \
has become unreliable -- making plans one day, and canceling them the next."""

{name} is a {race} {gender} who has completed {education}. Up until a year ago, life was pretty \
okay for {name}. While nothing much is going wrong in {name}'s life, {pronoun_subject} sometimes \
feels worried, a little sad, or has trouble sleeping at night. {pronoun_subject_upper} feels that \
at times things bother {pronoun_object} more than they bother other people and that when things go \
wrong, {pronoun_subject} sometimes gets nervous or annoyed. Otherwise, {name} is getting \
along pretty well. {pronoun_subject_upper} enjoys being with other people and although {name} \
sometimes argues with {pronoun_possessive} family, {name} has been getting along pretty well with \
{pronoun_possessive} family."""
